# Financial Budget Assistant

##My Personal Project

[**Project Proposal**]

The main purpose of this application is to scope and plan out a monthly budget based on a given take-home salary/income
and to insert any expenses e.g. titled Rent $1000, then it can even categorize these expenses (e.g. essential living)
and represent the monthly savings (or debt) visually alongside a percentage saved since the objective is to manage
money better. (Java GUI, CSS)

This is of use to anyone, but it's extremely helpful as a quick and easy tool for people of all ages
regardless of their experience of technology/computers to calculate their average expenses and cut down on anything.
I've always been in
terested in living a frugal / minimalist lifestyle alongside finance so this will benefit me in cost 
averaging and budget management.
