# Financial Budget Assistant

The main purpose of this application is to scope and plan out a monthly budget based on a given take-home salary/income
and to insert any expenses e.g. titled Rent $1000, then it can even categorize these expenses (e.g. essential living)
and represent the monthly savings (or debt) visually alongside percentage saved.

This is of use to anyone, but it's extremely helpful as a quick and easy tool for people of all ages
regardless of their experience of technology/computers to calculate their average expenses and cut down on anything.
I've always been interested in living a frugal / minimalist lifestyle alongside finance so this will benefit me in cost 
averaging and budget management.
